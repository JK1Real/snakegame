# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game features a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## Features

- Control the snake's movement using arrow keys: up, down, left, right.
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- Keep track of the player's score.
- Display a "Game Over" message when the game ends.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JK1Real/snakegame.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd snakegame
```

3. **Run the `main.py` file to start the game:**

```bash
python main.py
```

4. **Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard.**
5. **Eat food (blue circles) to grow the snake and earn points.**
6. **Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's body.**
7. **Try to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.**

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included in Python standard library)

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script to run the Snake game.
- `snake.py`: Contains the `Snake` class that defines the behavior of the snake.
- `food.py`: Contains the `Food` class responsible for creating food items for the snake to eat.
- `scoreboard.py`: Defines the `Scoreboard` class to keep track of and display the player's score.
- `wall.py`: Implements the `Wall` class for creating boundary walls in the game.

## Customization

- You can customize the game's appearance and behavior by modifying the constants and settings in the Python files.
- Adjust the speed of the snake, size of the game window, colors, and more to suit your preferences.
